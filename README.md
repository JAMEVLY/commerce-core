# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This template follows the Gitflow model, with branches designated for different stages of development (develop, release, main), along with a demo branch for showcasing experimental features or demos.

Feel free to clone this repository template to kickstart your next Node.js and React project with TypeScript, equipped with essential dependencies and a structured development workflow.


## Branch Structure

**develop:** This branch is where development takes place. All feature branches are merged into this branch during the development phase.

**release:** When the development cycle is nearing completion, a release branch is created from the develop branch. Any final adjustments or bug fixes for the release are made here.

**main:** This branch represents the production-ready code. Once a release is thoroughly tested and ready for deployment, it is merged into the main branch.

**demo:** This branch can be used to showcase demos or experimental features without interfering with the main development workflow.
